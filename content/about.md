Hi, I'm **Patrick Deutsch**.

I'm a software engineer who enjoys building things, breaking things, and occasionally writing about both. This blog is where I share thoughts on:

- Software architecture and development
- Infrastructure and DevOps
- Tools and workflows that make life easier
- Random technical adventures
